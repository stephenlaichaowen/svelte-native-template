## Svelte Native Template

This is a barebones svelte-native project template. It was created directly from a nativescript core project template. It provides an easy way to get started with a svelte native project.

### Usage

You can get started with this using `degit`:

```
npx degit halfnelson/svelte-native-template myapp
cd myapp
npm install
```

Your svelte-native app will be found in the `myapp` folder.

Once installed use the `tns preview`, `tns build` or `tns run` commands as for a normal NativeScript application.

Example: install & run application on your device:

```
tns run android
# or
tns run ios
```

Run this command to get a QRCode and scan with `Playground` APP in your mobile phone, this will not install app in your mobile device
```
tns preview
```
